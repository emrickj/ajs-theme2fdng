This is a responsive and extensible AngularJS theme using Bootstrap 4.  The contents of the website and dropdown menu are stored in data files in the `data` directory.  You can easily add or remove dropdown menus with minor changes to code.  See code for more information on how to do that.  Use the `p` parameter in URL to access individual pages.  Use `w=2` parameter to access pages in the dropdown menu.
